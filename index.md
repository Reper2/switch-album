# Welcome to S.☆Penguin's Nintendo Switch/2's Album

You may have come here from [Sherbet Penguin's ACNH Website](/acnh) to download the album of my Animal Crossing screenshots. Which can be found below in the list of download links. The screenshots detail most of my island's history, as well as other things. Some pictures have been omitted, as they did not have purpose.

I'm starting to use this repository as a database for backgrounds and other things on my websites.

    <summary>Also if you're wondering how I keep this up-to-date without going through a process of QR Code scanning, let me explain...</summary>
    After I've finished up whatever game I'm playing (or was playing) on my Switch, I close the game and (properly) power off the Switch. Then, I open the SD Card hatch on the back of the Switch and take out the MicroSD Card. Using a special type of USB-C (that doesn't store data) which has a SD and MicroSD Card input on the side, I insert the MicroSD Card from my Switch and plug the USB-C into the Thunderbolt port of my computer. I then load the USB Drive that has the MicroSD inserted in File Explorer and navigate to [D:\Nintendo\Album](D:\Nintendo\Album) (D is the drive letter unless D is already taken), which is where my entire Nintendo album is located. Obviously acnh is not the only thing in my album, I do take captures in other games sometimes too. After I copy+paste everything from the drive over to this folder, I have to filter out all the non-acnh content (manually) as this is just an album for acnh. When I update this, I add the new photos/videos 1 day after they were taken in case I take more in that day. I only copy+paste the folder with the new photos/videos as it would be inefficient to do it any other way.

Bla, bla, bla, that was me old self, now I just use a USB cable between my Switch 2 and my Mac to transfer the screenshots.
